# Choose your Adventure Maker

Do you want to create a Choose your Own Adventure game on the web? Well now you can. To start making your adventure, start with [the link here](https://zeyu-li.github.io/choose_your_own_adventure_react_maker/event_generator/index.html). This website will help you generate your adventure. Then go to the [releases](https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/choose_your_own_adventure_react_maker/releases), download a recent release, unzip it and place your generated JSON adventure into the JSON folder (+ images you specified in the images folder). Now you can go to the website (index.html) and your adventure will begin. This is a website you can host (or with GitHub pages) and share with your friends



**NOTE, YOU DO NOT NEED REACT**

React is only for development and you can just take the website template in [releases](https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/choose_your_own_adventure_react_maker/releases) and follow the instruction above to get a working static website



## Setup (same as above but in step form)

1. To start making your adventure, start with [the link here](https://zeyu-li.github.io/choose_your_own_adventure_react_maker/event_generator/index.html) (for help, press the **?** (Help) button)
2. Then go to the [releases](https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/choose_your_own_adventure_react_maker/releases): https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/choose_your_own_adventure_react_maker/releases
3. **Download** a recent release and unzip it
4. **Place** the generated JSON from the website and images into the images folder (these have to have the same name as the one specified in the adventure website generator)
5. Run the website by double clicking the index.html
6. **Share** with your friends!
